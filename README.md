#### Executed FPGA implementation and developed Python code for image processing. Utilized NumPy library for efficient array manipulation and data processing.
#### You can find here the implementation of a Fake Currency Detector on a BASYS-3 FPGA Board using Verilog and UART. Our main idea was the extraction of the security features of the note using Python, store them in Block Memory RAM in binary form and then compare it with the features of the original note.
